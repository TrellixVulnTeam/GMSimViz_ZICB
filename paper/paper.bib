abstract = {Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) is an open-source software package for the analysis and display of geoscience data, helping scientists to analyze, interpolate, filter, manipulate, project, and plot time series and gridded data sets. The GMT toolbox includes about 80 core and 40 supplemental program modules sharing a common set of command options, file structures, and documentation. Its power to process data and produce publication-quality graphic presentations has made it vital to a large scientific community that now includes more than 25,000 individual users. GMT's website (http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/) exceeds 20,000 visits per month, and server logs show roughly 2000 monthly downloads.}
