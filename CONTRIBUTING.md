## Contributing Code

* Tests should be run before contributing code. Run `py.test --mpl`. If GMSimViz is not installed, you can try `python -m pytest` from the repo root. Also run the non-unit test in tests/gmsimviz-compare.py to test the overall workflow.
* We use [Black](https://github.com/ambv/black) to format the code.
